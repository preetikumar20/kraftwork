This is readme file for the assignment 5.1 "Required Assignment 5.1: Will the Customer Accept the Coupon?"
## Observations Summary
Based on thses observations, it seems that the acceptance of bar coupons is high 41%. Also the drivers who visit the bar frequently (more than 3 times a month) are more likely to accept the coupon. The drivers who visit bar more than once a month and go to cheap restaurants more than 4 times and with less than 50K income are more likely to accept the coupon than the drivers who go to bars more than once a month, had no kid passengers, and are not widowed and are under the age of 30.

## Independent observations summary 

Based on independent observation, it is clear that the drivers who visit coffee house more frequently and also moving in the same direction will accept the coffee house coupon. So the direction is also a factor when considering the acceptance of the coupon.
